# Example1

This example contains a simple setup that shows how to use the data generated by the capture rig.

## Shaders

### CaptureRigUV

This is an URP shader sub graph node that has the UV calculation that is needed in order to sample the texture at the right spot (with the absolute world location-, capture rig location-, capture size- offsets).

### HeightMapPreview

A basic unlit shader that uses the [CaptureRigUV](#captureriguv) to display the capture rig output.
